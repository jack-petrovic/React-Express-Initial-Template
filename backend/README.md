# Server PDFTron Collaboration

Simple express server based off of [express-generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). Includes [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) for automatic server restarting. The server complies with the [RESTful API Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and allows interaction with the [MYSQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database administration system in real time.
